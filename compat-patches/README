WARNING
=======

Please avoid using the compat-patches/ to implement support for old kernels.
This should be the last resort.

 * it is nearly always possible to use compat-includes/ to do the same with a
   lot less problems

 * maintaining these patches is *censored*

GENERATING A PATCH
==================

If it not possible to avoid a patch then please make the patch as small as
possible. Even refactor the code which has to be patched to reduce the
size/number of the changes.

Please use git-format-patches to generate them and order same inside via the
XXXX- prefix of the patch name.

    git format-patch --abbrev=7 -U3 --diff-algorithm=histogram --no-signature \
	--format=format:'From: %an <%ae>%nDate: %aD%nSubject: [PATCH] %B' -1
